# Review decisions — October 2026

Decisions taken during the code review. **Nothing here is implemented yet.**
All of it lands in one implementation stage at the end of the review.

## D1 — No `enum` keyword; `as const` objects instead

TypeScript string enums are *nominally* typed: a plain `string` from
`@x402/core` is not assignable to an enum member without a cast. This code
reads strings off the wire constantly (`network`, `scheme`, `invalidReason`,
`errorReason`), so `enum` would require a cast at every boundary — the exact
thing D6 is meant to remove. `const enum` is already impossible here:
`isolatedModules: true` forbids it.

```ts
export const Phase = { Verify: "verify", Settle: "settle" } as const;
export type Phase = (typeof Phase)[keyof typeof Phase];
```

Gives autocomplete, a usable type, `Object.values()` for tests, and direct
comparison with SDK strings.

Supporting (not decisive, since we run tsx): TS 5.8's `erasableSyntaxOnly`
forbids `enum`, because Node's native type stripping rejects it outright.

**Placement:** vocabulary crossing role boundaries (`SettlementState`,
`Phase`, `RefusalKind`) → `src/shared/enums.ts`. Values used by one role only
→ an enums/constants file inside that role's folder. Shared means shared, not
"all constants in one pile".

**Touches:** shared/classify.ts, facilitator/server.ts, facilitator/wire.ts,
agent/client.ts.

## D2 — Structured logging with pino, request-scoped child loggers

Not for prettier output. Log lines are currently strings, and the thing we
most need to do with them is *query*: "show me every payment that reached
pending" should be a filter, not a grep. The ledger is about to key on the
same values, so logs and rows should share a vocabulary.

- `pino`, with `pino-pretty` as a **dev-only** transport.
- `src/shared/logger.ts` exports the factory; each role makes a child with its
  own `service` field.
- Routes bind `attemptId` once via `log.child({ attemptId })`, so
  `[verify ae35d3ed]` and `[settle ae35d3ed]` become a join rather than two
  lines that happen to look alike.
- Levels: `info` for normal verify/policy/settle; `warn` for malformed
  requests and policy vetoes; `error` for thrown settles and dead RPC;
  `debug` for the stall harness.

**Pure functions never log.** `classify`, `decide` and the wire parsers return
values; the caller logs the result. Keeps them testable with no logger to
construct. Where a deeper impure function needs context (ledger writes, the
reconciler), use Node's `AsyncLocalStorage` rather than threading a logger
argument through.

**Never log:** signed transaction bytes or the full payment payload. Large,
and on mainnet a signed-but-unbroadcast transaction in a log file is a real
exposure. Log the message hash and attempt id instead.

**Out of scope for 2 Nov:** a `/metrics` endpoint. Note as a known gap in the
README.
